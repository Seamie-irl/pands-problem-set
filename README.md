Student ID: G00376550

### Introduction
In order to be able to view the solutions, you might like to have:
+ A GitHub account
+ Visual Studio Code (or other software which will display the code in the file e.g. Anaconda)
+ Knowledge on how to access the Windows Command Prompt (Command Line Interface) and how to run commands

An appendix at the end of this document provides an outline on how to achieve the above criteria

However, as you're reading this, you're in GitHub and by clicking on the solutions as described below you can view the coding in this manner without having to install any software.

### The problem set
A set of ten problems were presented to the class during the winter semester of 2019 for the **Programming and Scripting** module of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data analytics. The list of questions can be viewed here. https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/problems-pands-2019/raw/master/problems.pdf

### My solutions - background
I have been programming / scripting in one form or another for over 30 years, mostly for personal enjoyment. However, in the last two decades I've also used it for work. My experience is in Visual Basic and SQL though I've also dipped a toe into C++ and MS-DOS batch scripts. As a result of this, a lot of my solutions were trial-and-error. Perhaps not the most efficient method but certainly the most enjoyable and rewarding. I generally created my code and debugged it as I went along. The biggest issue were the minor syntax changes from language to language (for example, placing a colon at the end of loop statement lines). Only when I'd been unable to work out the syntax of code, or indeed the code itself did I search online. Depending on my need at the time I'd either use the Python or StackOverflow websites (see references)

### My solutions - hierarchy
Initially, as I worked on each solution in turn I saved the file with the same filename in the question. However, this created a problem with question 8 where the filename suggested was 'datetime.py'. DateTime is a reserved word so I reverted to identifying each question by Exercise Number.

### My solutions - each solution
Each file beginning with the text 'Exercise' is the solution to the associated numbered question.

At the top of each file I have commented the question and a brief outline of my approach. Thereafter, I have broken the solution into parts and commented to explain the process.

### My Solutions - References
Where I've directly used code in my solutions, the link to the source of the code is commented.
